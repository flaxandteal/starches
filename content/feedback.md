The NIHED Public Asset Viewer is a new service. It is currently experimental, but will be rolled out soon for initial feedback.

### Arches

This leverages technology from the [Arches](https://www.archesproject.org/) community,
as well as standalone components within the Asset Viewer on which user research is actively being conducted. **It is not an Arches instance
iself, but is an automatic build from exported Arches data.** When deployed, it will deep-link to (public) Arches resource reports, concepts and searches
from the Public Asset Viewer search and asset pages.

### Audience

Based on feedback from users of existing public cultural heritage tools managed by the Department of Communities, the target audience for this service is:

* general public in Northern Ireland
* visitors to Northern Ireland
* cultural researchers with high-level interest in specific assets[^1]
* members of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (including HED) to do "quick lookups"
* businesses, including the media
* public sector staff in neighbouring jurisdictions

[^1]: a full Arches instance for advanced search and public reference records will be made available in parallel, for deeper data exploration

### Feedback

For the purposes of providing feedback to the Department of Communities and to the external development team, [Flax &amp; Teal Limited](flaxandteal.co.uk), the
below form uses Google Forms. **Please note that this a third-party forms service and sets [third-party cookies](/cookies/) to allow
submission and storage of feedback.**

If you have direct feedback, we are glad to receive it. If you have been asked to help us evaluate this tool, and would like to have
suggested tasks to help structure your exploration, please try:

 - finding an asset that you are familiar with
 - finding assets near to a chosen location
 - finding the Meeting Rooms in Belfast
 - finding asset HB01/09/002II
 - sharing a set of a search results
 - sharing a single asset page

We are keen to receive feedback on usage both on mobile and desktop.

Types of tasks that would not be envisaged as in-scope for the Public Asset Viewer include anything that could be better performed
using the Arches service, e.g. multifactor searches, searching on controlled vocabularies, non-trivial geospatial search, full-text
search, relationship exploration, data editing.

Thank you for providing feedback to us on this service.
