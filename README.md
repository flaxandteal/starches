# Starches [alpha]

Static-site for running directly from Arches JSON data. Uses [alizarin](https://github.com/flaxandteal/alizarin/).

### Quickstart

Steps:

1. Populate `static/definitions/business_data`, `static/definitions/collections` and `static/definitions/reference_data` directories
2. Check the `MODEL_FILES` are right in `utils/reindex.js`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run reindex`
5. Run `hugo serve`

### License

Currently, and you should assume for the foreseeable future,
any use of this package, even as a front-end library, carries AGPL requirements and that
means any derived work must be licensed appropriately, with shared source-code. This, for
avoidance of doubt, means original untranspiled Javascript, Typescript etc. must be made
public to all web-users for the whole of any web platform using this library.

**This library unlikely to be suitable for use in most traditional commercial products.**

We may, in future, dual-license or relicense this package more liberally, so please note
that we will expect **any PRs to be MIT-licensed** to enable the possibility.
This may seem lopsided if we begin receiving PRs on the scale of the existing project,
so if you are considering doing a
substantial piece of work, get in touch beforehand to see if a relicense is possible (which
may depend on third-party discussions) and how we can handle it.

**Please note** that there is third-party code in the `tests/` subdirectory.
