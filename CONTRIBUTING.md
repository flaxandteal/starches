## Coding Standards

We follow these coding standards:

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- Follow ES Modules syntax for imports
- Provide explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces for complex object types
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Formatting

- Use 2-space indentation
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for string literals
- Use template literals for multi-line strings
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use consistent line breaks and spacing
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Best Practices

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Break complex functions into smaller ones
